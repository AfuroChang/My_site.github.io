              I was responsible for UX research and UI design, from defining the

            <p>
              In only 3 months, we achieved a rapid increase in the number of
              new users after app design improvement (3000% increase in MAU,
              +40% new users). My homepage design proposal was very successful
              in driving significant growth in new users on the app and got good
              user reviews in the App Store.

            <p>
              In the early stage of this project, I conducted user research and
              interviews to identify the core problems and get a sense of how
              users perceive our product. What are their expectations?

            <p>
              I also consolidated the research result and created personas based
              on what we learned from the interview. It helped the entire team
              better understanding who we're designing for and what would be the
              most important things we should focus on.

          Through user research, interviews, workshop and data analysis, we
          deeply explored why the target users did not like to use Es2move to
          place orders, and uncovered their real needs in order to optimize the
          website and increase the utilization rate.

              We provided standard delivery and urgent (express) delivery
              options. The user could check and view the best price based on
              their needs. The system would give a more accurate cost estimate
              according to the type of goods selected by the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also added order discount offers to incentivize users to place
              orders on the official website by letting users know that Es2move
              would meet their requirements at the lowest price. It also wired
              discount tags to attract users to place orders on the official
              website

              As soon as a user selects the pricing rule, he is directed to the
              order page to fill in the remaining details, such as the recipient
              and company name. Users can also directly apply the company's main
              address to save time filling out the form, quickly complete the
              order, and view related information on all devices simultaneously.
